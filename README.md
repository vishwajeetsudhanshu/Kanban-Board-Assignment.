## Optimistic UI Approach (State Rollback Handling)

   This project implements an Optimistic UI update strategy for a smooth user experience
   
# What is Optimistic UI?

  Optimistic UI updates the frontend state immediately before waiting for server confirmation.


## How it works in this project:

 1. When a task is moved between columns:

    - The UI updates instantly.

    - The Zustand store updates immediately.

 2. If a backend API fails (future scalable architecture):

      - The previous state is stored.

      - The state is rolled back to maintain consistency.

  This ensures:

  - Faster interaction

  - Better user experience

  - Minimal UI delay

## 📈 Future Improvements

 - Backend integration (Node.js + MongoDB)

 - Real-time collaboration (WebSockets)

 - User roles & permissions

 - Task priority & deadlines

 - Dark Mode toggle
